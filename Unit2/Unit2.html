      <p> The weapons in Terraria all differ in there ability. Most of the weapons are cassified into 4 catagory. 
        <ul>
          <li> Melee </li>
          <li> Ranger </li>
          <li> Mage </li> 
          <li> Summoner </li>
        </ul>
      <p> These four "classes" are used in the game to make the game more diffcult. But all of them have weapons that go with it. I want to talk about the Melee class of weapons. </p>
      <p> The weapons that are most important in the game are has follows </p>
        <ol type= "a"> 
          <li> Wood swords </li>
          <li> copper - Platium sword (these are made from the beginning pre-hardmode ore)
          <li> Blade of Grass, Fiery Greatsword, Lights bane/Blood Butcherer, Muramasa. these Four swords are used to make one sword called the Nights edge. </li>
          <li> Excalibur </li>
          <li> True Excalibur </li>
          <li> True Nights Edge </li>
          <li> Using the True Excalibur &amp; True Nights Edge you can make the sword The Terra Blade </li>
          <li> The final sword thats considered the best sword in the game is called the Zenith </li>
        </ol> 
      <p> Thats the basic Melee weapons you can obtain in Terraria and some of the strongest ones aswell </p>
